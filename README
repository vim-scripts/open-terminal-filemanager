Some vim user want to shell like emacs's eshell. But vim don't support shell, 
terminal interface in vim (at least  7.x version). 

In this situation, I try some terminal patches or shell attached plugins. But everyone don't perfectly emulate native terminal or have much dependencies. So I use simple native terminal and filemanager open script for my various platforms. 



Commmands 
    :OpenTerminal              Open native terminal sw. 
    :OpenFilemanager        Open native file manager. 



Key map recommendations (I'm using) 
   nnoremap <silent> <F9> :OpenTerminal<CR> 
   nnoremap <silent> <F10> :OpenFilemanager<CR><CR> 



Tested platform 
 * Mac  ~ Terminal.app,      finder
  * MacVim
 * Windows 7 64bit, XP ~cmd.exe , explorer 
  * [portable] gVim
 * Gnome  ~ gnome-terminal,  nautilus
  * gVim

This is very simple script. If plugin show wrong operation feedback to me. I can't test in windows xp, KDE etc  :)
